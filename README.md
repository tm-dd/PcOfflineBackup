# pcOfflineBackup
This script allows to make an backup (and a restore script) of the most PCs or laptops, after booting from a live linux system, like the System Rescue CD.

The scripts are using the partclone software and other linux tools to analyse the partition table, backup partitions and write an restore script.

Before you can use it, please change the parameters and download and compile static versions of partclone, like written in this documentation: https://github.com/Thomas-Tsai/partclone/wiki/Build-package

PLEASE NOTE, YOU USE THE SCRIPT ON YOUR OWN RISK.
PLEASE ALWAYS DOUBLE CHECK THE MESSAGES AND BACKUP FILES, AND DO NOT DELETE THE ORIGINAL, BEFORE YOU SUCCESSFULLY RESTORE THE FIRST CLONE.
